This is release 1.0.3 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - Clarify licensing in lite of the new GPLv3 license;
  - New --force option to handle unexpected problems with the data repository;
  - Better logging and status handling when we invoke external commands
  - Clearer backup status on job end.
  - A small packaging bug got fixes.
