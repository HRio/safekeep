This is release 1.4.5 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

This is bug-fix update, primarily as a final Python 2 version.  What's in this
release:
  - Make ssh StrictHostKeyChecking configurable in safekeep.conf with
    'ask' as default if not configured.
  - Add make-target debsrc again
  - Fix compatibility issue with Python 2.4

Many thanks to all those who sent in bug reports and fixes that made this
release possible, and to Dimi Paun for his continual work with SafeKeep.
