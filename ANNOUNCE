This is release 1.0.4 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - Add options to allow the query of the backup repository
  - Important fixes when dealing with snapshots
  - Make it more compatible with Python 2.2 (more work remains)
  - Avoid build-time dependency on asciidoc which depends on Python 2.3
  - Add some clarifications to the documentation
  - Add support for FreeBSD
