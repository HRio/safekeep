This is release 1.0.1 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - The safekeep user no longer requires a working shell
  - Add support for Fedora 7 to the testing script
  - Packaging improvements for integration into Fedora
  - Remove the old configuration migration scripts
  - Do not package the testing script, it's used only during development

the release is available at the public sites. Sources and binaries will be 
available from the following locations:
