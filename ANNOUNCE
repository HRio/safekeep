This is release 0.9.2 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - Client configuration files have been moved to 
    /etc/safekeep/backup.d, and have the extension '.backup';
  - A new global configuration file has been added in 
    /etc/safekeep/safekeep.conf;
  - A number of command line options have been deprecated;
    (-e/--email, -s/--smtp), and moved to the global configuration.
  - SafeKeep now knows of the user under which the backup will execute,
    making it possible to better deploy keys, avoid the need to invoke
    safekeep(1) via sudo(8), and execute the backup as root if need be;
  - Relative paths now have more intuitive behaviour;
  - Some documentation improvements;
  - Automatic migration of old configuration to the new format;
  - A CRITICAL (e.g. data loss) race has been fixed.
