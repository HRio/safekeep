This is release 1.2.0 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - Implement bandwidth limiting, based on trickle
  - Add support for niced backup server (defaults to nice +10)
  - External callbacks throughout the backup process
  - Several minor improvements and fixes in usability
  - We now backup all special files by default 
  - Add pass-through options for the DB dump command
  - Allow passing the pgpasswd to PostgreSQL
  - Avoid errors for mounts containing spaces
  - Correctly handle LVM names that contain dashes
  - Fix dopey MySQL dump.

Many thanks to Frank Crawford for providing many patches
for new features and bug fixes in this release.
