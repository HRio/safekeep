This is release 1.4.2 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

This is primarily a bug fix update, but what's new in this release:
  - Report setup errors in summary reports.
  - Added a flag to disable a backup configuration file.
  - Added new targets for building Debian source packages.
  - A number of bug fixes for Python compatibility and other errors.
 
Many thanks to Henrik Riomar and Terry Phelps for their bug reports
and fixes that made this release possible, and to Dimi Paun for his
continual work with SafeKeep.
