This is release 1.5.0 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

This is a rebase of the source to Python 3, with the same functionality
as 1.4.5.

Many thanks to all those who sent in bug reports and fixes that made this
release possible, and to Dimi Paun for his continual work with SafeKeep.
