This is release 1.4.3 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

This is primarily a long delayed update, and includes a number of enhancements
and bug fixes.  What's in this release:
  - Updated server-side scripting and general cleanups of code and documentation
  - Documentation cleanup
  - Optionally remove CREATE DATABASE statement in dumps as proposed
	by Marco Bozzolan <mailbox@s19n.net>
  - Added configuration option to specify ssh-keygen settings
  - Attempt normal lvremove before invoking dmsetup for cleanup
  - Correct email subject for errors during list output
  - Added locking on the server to stop overlapping runs
  - Update documentation for SSH change
  - Support for SSH ed25519 keys, switch default key type to RSA
	from Alexander List <alex@list.priv.at>
  - Added server side startup hook support.
  - Fixed a couple of small bugs related to:
    - report errors during server cleanups,
    - missing remote scripts, and
    - client errors not reported by server during cleanups.
  - Sort entries based on IDs as proposed by Carl Franks <carl@fireartist.com>
  - Applied long outstanding patches from 2014
    - Fix lvremove error as reported by Eric Aslakson <ericaslakson@hotmail.com>
    - Clean up html generation with patches from
	Stanislav Blokhin <stanislav.blokhin@tomologic.com>
