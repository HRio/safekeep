This is release 1.4.0 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - Add the ability to store script files on either client or server.
  - Rewritten snapshot creation to remove use of "rbind".
  - Automatic cleanup on next run after an abort.
  - Support of LVM tagging for snapshots.
  - Better handling of messages and tracebacks.
  - A number of other code cleanups and bug fixes.
  - Updated minimum Python support to Python 2.3.

Many thanks to Andres Toomsalu, Ken Bass, Joe Steele and Alexander List
for the fixes that made this release possible, and to Dimi Paun for his
continual work with SafeKeep.
