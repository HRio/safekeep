This is release 1.0.5 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - Allow providing the password for the DB user used for the DB dump
  - Add config option for passing additional flags to rdiff-backup
  - Avoid backing up special files by default
  - Avoid creating multiple LVM snapshots (avoids some LVM bugs)
  - Add new --cleanup option to help recovery from crashes
  - Make it easier to package on platforms that don't have asciidoc

Many thanks to Frank Crawford for providing patches for
most of the new features and bug fixes in this release!
