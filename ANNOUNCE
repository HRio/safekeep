This is release 1.3.3 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

What's new in this release:
  - More fixes for dealing with LVM snapshots.
  - Better handling of other failure conditions.
  - Updates for Python syntax issues and changes.
  - Allow specification of a sender address in e-mail messages.
  - Better handling of ionice(1).

Many thanks to Marco Bozzolan and Harald Nehring for the fixes
that made this release possible, and to Dimi Paun for his continual
work with SafeKeep, who is currently having a life away from computers.
