This is release 1.4.4 of SafeKeep, a centralized and easy to use 
backup application that combines the best features of a mirror 
and an incremental backup.

This is bug-fix update, primarily to fix a major issue.  What's in this
release:
  - Fix error with key deployment reported by Bruce Cowan <bcowan@noao.edu>
  - Cleanup up some minor issues in the build and deployment process

Many thanks to all those who sent in bug reports and fixes that made this
release possible, and to Dimi Paun for his continual work with SafeKeep.
