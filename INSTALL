PACKAGE INSTALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is highly recommended that you install the packaged version of 
SafeKeep via the provided RPMs or DEBs.


SOURCE INSTALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to install from source, you can do so by running (as root):

   $ make install

On the server side, you need to create the storage directory and user:
   $ install -d -m 750 "/var/lib/safekeep"
   $ install -d -m 700 "/var/lib/safekeep/.ssh"
   $ groupadd -f -r safekeep
   $ useradd -r -g safekeep -d /var/lib/safekeep -s /sbin/nologin safekeep


INSTALL NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Safekeep is designed such that the same script can be used on both the 
backup server (which initiates backups from clients), as well as on 
individual clients to handle client specific tasks such as 
dedicated ssh key generation and client-side backup processes such as dump. 

As a result, safekeep is packaged in such a way that clients which want 
to communicate with a safekeep managed backup server can choose to install 
the safekeep-client subpackage to ensure correct safekeep client 
configuration. This safekeep-client subpackage does not itself install any 
additional files at this time. But it does ensure that the correct client 
side applications are in place for safekeep managed backup services.

It is recommended that all computers acting as safekeep clients install 
the safekeep-client subpackage, even though at this time it is 
technically optional if the necessary components such as an ssh server, 
coreutils and util-linux are installed correctly on the client Fedora 
system. In future version of safekeep the safekeep-client package may 
become necessary for correct client operation.
