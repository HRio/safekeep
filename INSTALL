PACKAGE INSTALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is highly recommended that you install the packaged version of 
SafeKeep via the provided RPMs or DEBs.


SOURCE INSTALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to install from source, you can do so by running (as root):

   $ make install

NOTE: installing this way is not equivalent to a package install. 
You will have to manually take care of a number of other
steps that are automatically taken care of by the packages such as
creating /etc/safekeep.d, installing the cron job script, creating
the safekeep user, and so on.

Please make sure you understand all the ramifications of doing a
source install before you chose this option. Feel free to ask
questions on the mailing list:
     safekeep-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
if you run into any problems.

INSTALL NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Safekeep is designed such that the same script can be used on both the 
backup server (which initiates backups from clients), as well as on 
individual clients to handle client specific tasks such as 
dedicated ssh key generation and client-side backup processes such as dump. 

As a result, safekeep is packaged in such a way that clients which want 
to communicate with a safekeep managed backup server can choose to install 
the safekeep-client subpackage to ensure correct safekeep client 
configuration. This safekeep-client subpackage does not itself install any 
additional files at this time. But it does ensure that the correct client 
side applications are in place for safekeep managed backup services.

It is recommended that all computers acting as safekeep clients install 
the safekeep-client subpackage, even though at this time it is 
technically optional if the necessary components such as an ssh server, 
coreutils and util-linux are installed correctly on the client Fedora 
system. In future version of safekeep the safekeep-client package may 
become necessary for correct client operation.
