Full Test
~~~~~~~~~
To run the full test simply invoke the target:
  $ make fulltest

However, to be able to run it successfully, you will need to
prepare a few things in advance:
  1. You need two boxes to act as a client and a server in the test.
     It is highly recommended that you use some virtual images that
     can suffer corruption, as the test will take control of them
     and perform all necessary steps to accomplish the task.

  2. Make sure you have the following names resolve to the IPs of 
     the above mentioned boxes:
                LaBackup-test-client
                LaBackup-test-server
     The easiest way to achive that is to have them in your /etc/hosts
     files like this:
192.168.4.128   LaBackup-test-client
192.168.4.129   LaBackup-test-server
	
  3. At the moment, it is assumed that the VMs will run a RPM based
     distro, preferably Fedora Core 5.

  4. You will need to develop from a box that can build rpms 
     (it needs rpmbuild(8)), in order to use the full test.
