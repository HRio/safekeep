These are ideas that we need to look at post 1.0.


Future:
  * Modify the test to not rely on Lattica's servers
  * Support more of rdiff-backup special file selectors
  * Document data restore
  * Find a way to show man page on website with header and footer
  * decide how big the snapshot size should be automagically
  * fully automatic shapshotting mode
  * configuration inheritance
  * transactional store of ops on server side, and automagic recovery from errors
  * Windows support for the client
  * Write SE Linux rules to limit access rights (akin to the httpd ones)
  * Add tests db dumps
  * Run the server in a chroot-jail
  * Compare mirroring with a straight `rsync`
