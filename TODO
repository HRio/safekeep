Next release:
  * Add configure script + an INSTALL file
  * Test the sendmail delivery method
  * Add tests db dumps
  * Avoid snapshotting snapshots
  * Don't snapshot a device if a snapshot is already present
  * Clarify snapshot usage in docs
  * local backup to bypass ssh

When I tried to run safekeep under FreeBSD I got an error: "bad interpreter". 
It was because the safekeep magic line is
#!/usr/bin/python
and in FreeBSD the python is located in the /usr/local/bin directory. 

When I chaged this line to (see python tutorial, 2.2.2):
#!/usr/bin/env python
the safekeep began to run w/o errors.

More thanks,
Igor Klingen

Future (post 1.0):
  * Support more of rdiff-backup special file selectors
  * Package it up for Ubuntu/Debian
  * Modify the test to not rely on Lattica's servers
  * Decide how big the snapshot size should be automagically
  * Fully automatic shapshotting mode
  * Configuration inheritance
  * Transactional ops on server side, and automagic recovery from errors
  * Windows support for the client
  * Write SE Linux rules to limit access rights (akin to the httpd ones)
  * Run the server in a chroot-jail
  * Compare mirroring with a straight rsync(1)
