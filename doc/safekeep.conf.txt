NAME
----
safekeep.conf - Configuration file for 'safekeep(1)'

SYNOPSIS
--------
This file resides in `/etc/safekeep/` from where it
will be automatically picked up by 'safekeep(1)'.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This configuration file holds safekeep global settings. 
The format of the file is a simple key-value pair similar
to Java properties files: lines starting with '#' are ignored
as comments, keys are separated from values by '=', and
leading and trailing spaces are ignored.

----------

backup.user::
	The Unix user under which the server will run.
	If not specified, `safekeep` will just run under the
	current user.

base.dir::
	The base directory for date repository relative paths.
	If not specified, it defaults to the home directory
	of the backup user.

email.to::
	In addition to writing the session logs
	on the standard output, `safekeep` can also send the
	logs via email to a number of recipients.
	This comma-separated list of emails designates
	the recipients of the logs. If not specified,
	`safekeep` will not attempt to email the logs.

email.smtp.server::
	Specifies the SMTP server used for sending mails 
	if the `email.to` specifies any recipients.
