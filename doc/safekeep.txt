NAME

safekeep - Client/server backup script

SYNOPSIS
--------
'safekeep' [-s] [-q] [-v] [-C file] [-e <email>] [-m <smtp>]

'safekeep' -c

'safekeep' -k [-q] [-v] [--status|--print|--deploy] <clientid>*

'safekeep' -h | -V

DESCRIPTION
-----------
SafeKeep is a client/server backup script which enhances the
power of rdiff-backup with simple configuration and use.

SafeKeep can work in server mode, client mode or SSH key management mode.

In server mode, SafeKeep parses a set of configurations files which
defines a set of backup clients. For each backup client, SafeKeep
connects to the client host over SSH (using a public key authentification
system previously set up using `safekeep -k --deploy`), and launches
`safekeep --client` onto the client host. The client does the real backup
and sends the data over SSH to the SafeKeep server which stores it in
the specified location.

In client mode, SafeKeep does a few setup steps, depending on the
client configuration (database dump, LVM device snapshot), then backups
the client data using `rdiff-backup`, and then cleanups the state
(removes the database dumps, deactivates the LVM snapshots)

Note that the client mode of SafeKeep should never be invoked manually,
this mode is meant to be used only by the server mode of SafeKeep.

The SSH key management mode is a helper mode for deploying or verifying
the setup of the SSH authentification keys.

Each mode accepts a few options as described below.

OPTIONS
-------
-s, --server::
	Selects the server mode (default)

-c, --client::
	Selects the client mode. This should never be invoked manually, the
	clients are started automatically by the server on the client machines
	using SSH.

-k, --keys::
	Selects the SSH key management mode

-h, --help::
	Selects the help mode, in which safekeep prints out the
	online help and exits.

-V, --version::
	Selects the version mode, in which safekeep prints out the
	version number and exits.

-q, --quiet::
	Decreases the verbosity level. Can be specified more than
	once.

-v, --verbose::
	Increases the verbosity level. Can be specified more than
	once.

-C, --cfg=FILE|DIR::
	Specifies the configuration file location.
	This can be a single file (for a single client configuration)
	or a directory containing several configuration files (one per
	backup client)

-e, --email=EMAIL::
	In addition to writing the session logs
	on the standard output, this parameter let the user specify
	the mail address where the logs are to be send. Can be specified
	more than once to send reports to multiple addresses.

-m, --smtp=SMTP::
	Specifies the SMTP server used for sending
	mails when `-e` is used. Defaults to `localhost`.

--status::
	(key mode only) Display the key status for the clients.

--print::
	(key mode only) Display the authorization keys for the clients.

--deploy::
	(key mode only) Deploy the authorization keys on the clients.

Configuration file
------------------

Each backup client is described by a configuration file in XML format of the
following form:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- the client backup id -->
<backup id="my.host.com primary backup">

  <!-- the client backup host, the user under which the servers will connect,
       the SSH keys used for launching "safekeep -c" and "rdiff-backup" -->
  <host
    name="localhost" user="guest"
    key-ctrl="/home/dimi/.ssh/backup_id_dsa"
    key-data="/home/dimi/.ssh/backup2_id_dsa"
  />

  <!-- location where the backuped data will be stored on the server
       and for how long (s=sec, m=min, h=hours, D=days, W=weeks, M=months, or Y=years) -->
  <repo
    path="./tmp"
    retention="10D"
  />

  <!-- settings for database dump and for volume snapshot -->
  <setup>

    <!-- database type ("postgres" or "mysql"), user with backup rights,
         location of the dump file on the client host, and flag to remove
	 or not the dump file after the backup is done -->
    <dump
      type="postgres"
      db="dbname"
      user="foobar"
      file="/var/backup/dumps/mydata"
      cleanup="true"
    />

    <!-- what volume is to be snapshoted (device location) and the size
         of the snapshot (unallocated space must exist in the volume group) -->
    <snapshot
      device="/path/to/volume"
      size="500M"
    />

  </setup>

  <!-- data to be backuped -->
  <data>
    <!-- each type of tag can be present more than one time -->
    <!-- if a database dump was created, it must be added in this section -->
    <include path="/home"/>
    <exclude path="/home/guest"/>

    <include glob="**/important/"/>
    <exclude glob="/home/*/tmp"/>

    <include regexp=".*\.ogg"/>
    <exclude regexp=".*\.mp3"/>
  </data>
</backup>
